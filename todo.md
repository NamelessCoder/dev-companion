# What is being worked on

This file exists so a session can end anywhere. It holds the **order of the
work** and where the last one stopped — not what must be true (that is
[requirements.md](requirements.md)), not the questions real sessions asked (that
is `feedback/`), not the map of what the audiences need (that is `scenarios/`).
Those three outlive the work; this one is consumed by it.

Rules that keep it from becoming a fourth backlog:

- An item names what it serves — a requirement, a note, a scenario. An item that
  serves nothing is not a task, it is an idea, and ideas go in the note that had
  them.
- An item says what the **next concrete step** is, in enough detail that someone
  who has read nothing else can start. "Continue with the bindings" is not that;
  "bind the statements in `php.json` against `.checkouts/12.4` and `13.4`" is.
- A finished item is deleted, not ticked. What it established is already in
  `requirements.md`, and the commit is the record that it happened.
- The order is the order. When something jumps the queue, it moves up here
  first, so the reason is written down before the work starts.

## Every session starts here: read `feedback/` again

This item is never done and is never deleted. Notes arrive while work is
happening — a session somewhere records what it was missing, and the file lands
in `feedback/` without anyone being told. And notes that were open yesterday are
often half answered by what shipped since, without their text saying so.

So, before picking anything up:

1. `typo3_feedback_list` — or read `feedback/` — for what is there now.
2. For each note, **run its own query against the current server**. A note is
   evidence about a version of this server that may no longer exist.
3. Close what is answered, trim what is half answered down to the part that is
   still open, and let a new note that changes the order move the items below.

The notes are the only input that comes from outside this repository. Everything
else here was written by someone who already knew what they meant.

## 1. A maintenance guide, once the pieces are there

**Serves:** `feedback/2026-07-29-100314`, scenario `SITE-02` · **Next step:**
write the upgrade order of operations into `knowledge/` — which step comes
first, what runs in which environment, when the wizards run relative to the
schema, what to do about third-party extensions. A guide that composes it with
`typo3_project_scope` and `typo3_changelog_lookup` comes after that.

The upgrade question is "what do I do, in which order, and what breaks". Three
of the four inputs exist now: `typo3_project_scope` knows what is installed,
`typo3_changelog_lookup` knows what changed, the console knows `upgrade:list`.
What is missing is the order of operations, and that is knowledge to be written
rather than a tool to be built — it belongs in `knowledge/` first.
